### **Statistics in Data Science**

**1. Introduction:**
- Role of statistics in data science and its types.

**2. Purpose of Statistics:**
- Convert raw data into meaningful information.
- Example: Analyzing employee salary data to understand average salary and derive insights for decision-making.

**3. Application in Real-World Scenarios:**
- Organizations use statistics to better plan expenditures and be competitive in the market.

    - The objective is to predict future trends based on current data.
    - Differentiates between population (whole entity) and sample (subset of the entity).
    - Descriptive statistics describe the sample, while inferential statistics generalize findings for the population.
    - For making inferences, probability theory is essential.

**5. Importance in Data Science:**
- Data science involves analyzing data, preparing reports, and predicting future trends.
- A solid understanding of statistics is crucial for meaningful data analysis and future predictions.

**6. Conclusion:**
- Statistics, with its two types, is indispensable in the field of data science.
