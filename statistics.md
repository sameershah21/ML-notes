**Statistics Topics for Data Science & Machine Learning Lecture Notes**

**1. Introduction:**
- Importance of statistics in data science and machine learning.

**2. Basic Terminology:**
- Definition of statistics.
- Role of statistics in data science and machine learning.
- Population vs. Sample: Foundation of data science studies.
- Census, Sources, Survey, Parameters, and Statistics.
- Data & Variables:
    - Independent vs. Dependent variables.
    - Predictors vs. Target variables.

**3. Descriptive Statistics:**
- Describes sample data through statistical measures and plots.
- Measures of Central Tendency:
    - Mean, Median, Mode.
- Measures of Variability and Spread:
    - Variance, Standard Deviation, Absolute Deviation, Min, Max, Range, Outliers, Quartiles, Interquartile range, Standard Score (Z-score).
- Plots & Graphs:
    - Histogram, Bar chart (stacked, side by side), Scatter plot, Line chart, Box plot.
- Data Distribution:
    - Normal, Skewed, Kurtosis.
- Central Limit Theorem:
    - Understanding the sampling distribution of means, expectation, variance of sampling mean.

**4. Probability Theory:**
- Essential for predictive modeling in machine learning.
- Topics:
    - Probability definition, Probability vs. Statistics, Sample space & events, Independent vs. Dependent events, Joint probability, Union probability, Marginal probability, Conditional probability & Bayes' theorem.
- Famous problems:
    - Monty Hall problem.
- Random Variables:
    - Discrete vs. Continuous, Probability Mass Function (PMF), Probability Density Function (PDF).
- Common Distributions:
    - Bernoulli, Geometric, Binomial, Poisson, Exponential, Normal/Gaussian.

**5. Inferential Statistics:**
- Generalizing from sample data to predict about the population.
- Topics:
    - Confidence levels & intervals, Standard error & margin of error, Hypothesis testing (Null vs. Alternate hypothesis, Significance level, Critical reason, P-value, Q-value, One-tail test, Two-tail test, Type I & II errors), Statistical tests (Z-test, T-test, Chi-square test, F-test), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA: One-way, Two-way).

**6. Additional Mathematics for Deep Understanding:**
- Linear algebra.
- Derivative calculus: Important for understanding machine learning algorithms.

**7. Miscellaneous:**
- Some consider Regression Analysis & Time Series Analysis as part of statistics, but these were reserved for the predictive modeling section.
- Importance of statistical knowledge to ensure accurate predictions in machine learning.

**8. Conclusion:**
- Solid statistical knowledge is paramount for machine learning expertise.
